# A form that is both symmetric and alternating

Away from characteristic two a bilinear form cannot be both symmetric and alternating without
being zero: symmetry and alternation give `B x y = B y x` and `B x y = -B y x`, so `2 * B x y = 0`,
and cancelling the `2` leaves `B x y = 0`.

That cancellation is all the hypothesis on the ring there is: `2` has to be regular, and nothing
is asked of any other element, so the statement covers rings with zero divisors elsewhere.  Over a
field, or over any domain, `IsRegular.of_ne_zero` supplies the hypothesis from `(2 : R) ≠ 0`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.BilinForm.eq_zero_of_isSymm_of_isAlt`: a symmetric alternating form over a ring in which
  `2` is regular is zero.
