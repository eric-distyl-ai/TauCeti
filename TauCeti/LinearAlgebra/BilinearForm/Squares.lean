# Bilinear forms from functionals on the second symmetric and exterior powers

A functional on `Sym²V` becomes a bilinear form on `V` by composing with the universal multilinear
map, and the form it produces is symmetric because the symmetric square does not see the order of
its two arguments; a functional on `⋀²V` becomes a form in the same way, and that form is
alternating because a repeated argument wedges to zero.  Both assignments are injective: the pure
tensors span the symmetric square, and on the exterior side the passage from a functional to an
alternating map is Mathlib's universal property, an equivalence.

Nothing here is representation theory: this is the dictionary that
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.CharacterTable.FrobeniusSchur.Trichotomy` runs the invariants of the
two squares through to reach invariant forms.  The symmetric side is available over a commutative
semiring, the exterior side over a commutative ring, which is where Mathlib's exterior power lives.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.BilinForm.ofSymmetricSquareDual` and `TauCeti.BilinForm.ofExteriorSquareDual`: a
  functional on the second symmetric or exterior power, read as a bilinear form on `V`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.BilinForm.isSymm_ofSymmetricSquareDual` and
  `TauCeti.BilinForm.isAlt_ofExteriorSquareDual`: the two forms are symmetric, respectively
  alternating.
* `TauCeti.BilinForm.ofSymmetricSquareDual_injective` and
  `TauCeti.BilinForm.ofExteriorSquareDual_injective`: a functional on either square is determined
  by the form it gives.

## Implementation notes

The two maps are built as plain linear maps rather than as equivalences onto the symmetric and the
alternating forms.  On the exterior side that equivalence is available: `ofExteriorSquareDual` is
`exteriorPower.alternatingMapLinearEquiv`, the universal property of the exterior power, followed
by `TauCeti.MultilinearMap.toBilinForm`, and its injectivity is the injectivity of that
equivalence.  On the symmetric side Mathlib has no universal property of the symmetric power -- it
is an explicit TODO of `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/TensorPower/Symmetric.lean` -- so surjectivity onto
the symmetric forms is not proved here; injectivity is read off the pure tensors spanning instead,
and is all the downstream counting needs.
