# The Weyl vector of a base

The **Weyl vector** `ρ` of a base of a root pairing is the half-sum of the positive roots. It is
the shift that turns the Weyl group action on weights into the dot action, and it appears in the
Weyl character, dimension and Kostant formulas as the correction `λ ↦ λ + ρ`.

Which roots are positive is defined only over a coefficient ring of characteristic zero, and
halving asks for `2` to be invertible on top of that. So the sum of the positive roots is
introduced first, as `TauCeti.twoWeylVector`, over a characteristic-zero coefficient ring, and the
Weyl vector itself only once `2` is invertible as well. The simple-coroot pairing and the simple
reflection identity are proved for the sum first and then divided by two; the statements that
speak of `ρ` alone — the dot action and the dominance results — are proved only in the halved
form. So nothing below assumes more of the coefficient ring than its own statement needs.

The one theorem the notion exists for is that `ρ` pairs to `1` with every simple coroot,
equivalently that the simple reflection `sᵢ` sends `ρ` to `ρ - αᵢ`. Its proof is the classical
one: `sᵢ` negates `αᵢ` and permutes the remaining positive roots, so the pairings of those
remaining roots with `αᵢ^∨` cancel in pairs and only `⟨αᵢ, αᵢ^∨⟩ = 2` survives.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.twoWeylVector`: the sum of the positive roots, that is `2ρ`.
* `TauCeti.weylVector`: the Weyl vector `ρ`, the half-sum of the positive roots, defined when `2`
  is invertible in the coefficient ring.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.coroot'_twoWeylVector` and `TauCeti.coroot'_weylVector`: `⟨2ρ, αᵢ^∨⟩ = 2` and
  `⟨ρ, αᵢ^∨⟩ = 1` for every simple root `αᵢ`.
* `TauCeti.reflection_twoWeylVector` and `TauCeti.reflection_weylVector`: `sᵢ(2ρ) = 2ρ - 2αᵢ` and
  `sᵢ(ρ) = ρ - αᵢ`.
* `TauCeti.sum_root_negRootsFinset`: the sum of the negative roots is `-2ρ`.
* `TauCeti.reflection_add_weylVector_sub_weylVector`: the dot action of a simple reflection,
  `sᵢ ⬝ λ = λ - (⟨λ, αᵢ^∨⟩ + 1) αᵢ`.
* `TauCeti.add_weylVector_mem_openDominantChamber` and
  `TauCeti.weylVector_mem_openDominantChamber`: over a linearly ordered coefficient ring the
  `ρ`-shift of a dominant weight is strictly dominant, and `ρ` itself is a regular weight.
* `TauCeti.openDominantChamber_nonempty`: consequently the open dominant chamber has a point,
  which over a general coefficient ring is a genuine hypothesis rather than a formality.

## References

This file supplies the root-pairing-level prerequisite of the `ρ` item of
`TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/LieHighestWeight/README.md`: Layer 1 there "only fixes the
notation `ρ` for the half-sum of positive roots and states dominance and integrality of weights",
and the Lie-algebra signature `weylVector (base : (LieAlgebra.IsKilling.rootSystem H).Base) :
Module.Dual K H` is stated in the Layer 5 section of that roadmap's `Suggested.lean`, where the
Casimir eigenvalue is the first consumer; the Weyl character and dimension formulas of Layer 6 are
stated in terms of the same `ρ`. Nothing here is a Lie-algebra-level declaration, and nothing here
uses the highest-weight machinery of Layers 2-4: `ρ` is built for an abstract root pairing, where
the positive-root combinatorics it needs already lives, so that the Lie-algebra target is a
specialization rather than a rebuild.

The argument is the one in J. E. Humphreys, *Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation
Theory*, GTM 9, Ch. III, §10.2 and §13.3.

the shifted Weyl group action that the highest-weight theory uses in place of the linear one, but
the statement that it permutes the highest weights of a given central character belongs to that
setting and needs its hypotheses. -/
