# Evaluating the division polynomials at a point of a Weierstrass curve

Mathlib relates the bivariate division polynomials `ψₙ`, `Ψₙ`, `φₙ` to their univariate companions
`ΨSqₙ`, `Φₙ` only inside the coordinate ring `R[W]`, as the identities
`Affine.CoordinateRing.mk_ψ`, `mk_Ψ_sq` and `mk_φ`. This file transports those identities to
honest equalities of ring elements at a point `(x, y)` **on** the curve, where evaluation
`Polynomial.evalEval x y` factors through `R[W]` by Mathlib's `AdjoinRoot.evalEval`.

The point of doing so is that `ΨSqₙ` and `Φₙ` are univariate: on the curve, `evalEval x y (ψ n)`
and `evalEval x y (Ψ n)` agree, and the square of the latter is a polynomial in `x` alone. That is
what later lets a rational-root argument run — not here, where `R` is an arbitrary commutative ring
and the theorem's coefficient hypotheses are not available, but downstream over a unique
factorization domain, where the degrees are Mathlib's `natDegree_Φ` (`n²`, over a nontrivial ring)
and `natDegree_ΨSq` (`n² - 1`, needing no zero divisors and `(n : R) ≠ 0`; in characteristic
dividing `n` the degree can drop). The identities below need none of those hypotheses.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.WeierstrassCurve.evalEval_ψ_eq_evalEval_Ψ`, `evalEval_Ψ_sq_eq_eval_ΨSq`,
  `evalEval_φ_eq_eval_Φ`: the three coordinate-ring identities, evaluated.
* `TauCeti.WeierstrassCurve.evalEval_Ψ_odd`: for odd `n`, `Ψₙ` evaluates to `(preΨ n).eval x`,
  with no `y` left. Composed with the first bullet, `simp` reduces `ψₙ` the same way.

Everything is stated over an arbitrary commutative ring; no domain, field or ellipticity hypothesis
is needed, because a coordinate-ring identity evaluates wherever the Weierstrass equation holds.

This is a prerequisite of the Nagell–Lutz integrality milestone of
`TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md`, Layer 6, item "The torsion subgroup and Nagell–Lutz",
whose route the roadmap records as "division polynomials".

## Provenance

Ported from the AINTLIB `NagellLutz` project (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0), pinned by
that roadmap at `dev/modular-curves @ 9fec8eba7652`:
`LutzNagell/LutzNagellTheorem/EvalBridge.lean`. That project runs against its own vendored copy of
Mathlib's division polynomials; here the statements are rebased onto pinned Mathlib's
`WeierstrassCurve.{ψ, Ψ, ΨSq, φ, Φ, preΨ}` and generalised from a field to a commutative ring.
