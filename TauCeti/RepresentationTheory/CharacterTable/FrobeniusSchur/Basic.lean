# The Frobenius-Schur indicator

For a finite group `G` and a finite-dimensional representation `ρ` of `G` over a field `k`, the
**Frobenius-Schur indicator** is the average of the character over squares,
`ν₂(ρ) = |G|⁻¹ ∑_g χ(g²)`.

The point of the indicator is what it counts. Mathlib's `Representation.character` averages to the
dimension of the invariants (`Representation.card_inv_mul_sum_char_eq_finrank`), and
`Representation.char_symmetricSquare_sub_char_exteriorSquare` says that the summand `χ(g²)` is the
difference of the symmetric-square and exterior-square characters at `g`. Averaging that identity
gives the main result of this file: the indicator is the signed count

`ν₂(ρ) = dim (Sym²V)ᴳ - dim (Λ²V)ᴳ`

of the invariants in the symmetric and exterior squares. Reading the companion identity
`Representation.char_tensorSquare` the same way shows that those same two invariant dimensions sum
to the dimension of the invariants of `V ⊗ V`.

Both identities are proved wherever `|G|` is invertible in `k`, with **no hypothesis on
characteristic two**, because the two character identities they average hold over every field: the
tensor square need not split for the two invariant counts to add up. The price is that a count of
invariants only ever appears here through its image in `k`, so in characteristic `p` the additivity
of the invariant dimensions is an identity of residues. Over a field of characteristic zero it
upgrades to an equality of natural numbers, and there the indicator is an integer.

This is the module-level half of the roadmap's Layer 7 pair; the `FDRep`-level indicator and its
agreement with this one are at the end of the file.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Representation.frobeniusSchurIndicator`: `ν₂(ρ) = |G|⁻¹ ∑_g χ(g²)`.
* `TauCeti.FDRep.frobeniusSchurIndicator`: the same indicator, for a `V : FDRep k G`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Representation.frobeniusSchurIndicator_eq_sub_finrank_invariants`: **the indicator is
  the signed count of invariants in the two squares**, `ν₂(ρ) = dim (Sym²V)ᴳ - dim (Λ²V)ᴳ`.
* `TauCeti.Representation.finrank_invariants_tprod_self`: **the two invariant dimensions add to
  that of the tensor square**, `dim (V ⊗ V)ᴳ = dim (Sym²V)ᴳ + dim (Λ²V)ᴳ`, as an identity in `k`
  in general (`TauCeti.Representation.finrank_invariants_tprod_self_cast`) and as natural numbers
  in characteristic zero.
* `TauCeti.Representation.frobeniusSchurIndicator_eq_intCast`: in characteristic zero the indicator
  is the integer `dim (Sym²V)ᴳ - dim (Λ²V)ᴳ`.
* `TauCeti.FDRep.frobeniusSchurIndicator_def`: the `FDRep`-level indicator is the indicator of the
  underlying representation.

## Implementation notes

The definition asks only for a `Fintype G`: invertibility of `|G|` is a hypothesis of the theorems,
not of the object. The two statements that do not mention the indicator ask only for `Finite G`,
and build the `Fintype` they average over inside their proofs.

The `FDRep`-level indicator is the module-level one applied to `V.ρ` rather than a second copy of
the average, so `TauCeti.FDRep.frobeniusSchurIndicator_def` unfolds that one definition and nothing
else, and every theorem about the average transfers through it. Neither definition is `@[expose]`d,
so the two `_def` lemmas are the only route to the two averages from another module; that is what
they are for. It is also why both are proved by a parenthesised `(rfl)`: a proof written
syntactically as `:= rfl` is implicitly tagged `@[defeq]`, and validating that tag on an exported
theorem asks that every definition it unfolds be exposed, which these two deliberately are not. The
parentheses suppress the tag, which is what `@[defeq]`'s own documentation prescribes them for; a
bare `rfl` does not compile here.
