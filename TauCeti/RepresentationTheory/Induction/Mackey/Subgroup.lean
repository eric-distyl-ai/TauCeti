# The Mackey subgroup

For subgroups `H` and `K` of a group `G` and an element `s : G`, the *Mackey subgroup*

`mackeySubgroup s H K = K ⊓ sHs⁻¹`

is the subgroup on which the summand of the Mackey decomposition attached to the double coset
`KsH` lives: the conjugate representation `{}^s A` is a representation of `sHs⁻¹`, it is restricted
along `mackeySubgroup s H K ≤ sHs⁻¹` and then induced along `mackeySubgroup s H K ≤ K`.  The two
inclusions are pinned here as `TauCeti.mackeyToConjH` and `TauCeti.mackeyToK`; there is no second
intersection with `K`.

The reason the Mackey subgroup is the right object is geometric.  The group `K` acts on `G ⧸ H` by
translation, and the stabilizer of the coset `sH` is exactly `mackeySubgroup s H K`
(`TauCeti.stabilizer_eq_mackeySubgroup_subgroupOf`, resting on the description
`TauCeti.stabilizer_quotientGroup_mk` of the stabilizer in `G` as the conjugate `sHs⁻¹`).  The
`K`-orbit of `sH` is the image of the double coset `KsH`
(`TauCeti.preimage_orbit_eq_doubleCoset`), so the partition of `G ⧸ H` into `K`-orbits is the
partition of `G` into double cosets, and orbit-stabilizer turns each orbit into an index:
`|K·sH| = [K : K ⊓ sHs⁻¹]`.  This is the combinatorial content of the Mackey decomposition, and it
yields the classical double-coset size formula `|KsH| · |K ⊓ sHs⁻¹| = |K| · |H|`
(`TauCeti.card_doubleCoset_mul_card_mackeySubgroup`).  The two facts about the translation action
that this rests on are generic group theory and live with the topics they belong to: the
stabilizer description in `TauCeti.GroupTheory.QuotientGroup.Basic` and the identification of a
double coset with an orbit in `TauCeti.GroupTheory.DoubleCoset.Orbits`.

Because the Mackey decomposition is indexed by double cosets while its summands are built from a
*chosen* representative, the dependence on the representative has to be pinned too: replacing `s`
by `k * s * h` with `k ∈ K` and `h ∈ H` conjugates the Mackey subgroup by `k`
(`TauCeti.mackeySubgroup_conj`), so the two subgroups are isomorphic
(`TauCeti.mackeySubgroupCongr`) and in particular have the same index in `K`.  Nothing here asserts
a canonical representative-independent summand; that would need coherent conjugation equivalences
of the representations themselves.

Everything in this file is a statement about subgroups of `G`, with no coefficients and no
representations; it is placed with the induction files because `mackeySubgroup` is the
roadmap-specific subgroup the induction and restriction of that layer run along.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.mackeySubgroup`: the subgroup `K ⊓ sHs⁻¹`.
* `TauCeti.mackeyToK`, `TauCeti.mackeyToConjH`: the two inclusions of the Mackey subgroup, into
  `K` and into `sHs⁻¹`.
* `TauCeti.mackeySubgroupCongr`: the isomorphism between the Mackey subgroups of two
  representatives of one double coset, and `TauCeti.mackeySubgroupOfCongr`, the same isomorphism
  with both sides read as subgroups of `K`.
* `TauCeti.mackeySubgroupSelfEquiv`: the identification of the Mackey subgroup of a representative
  lying in `H` with `H` itself.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.stabilizer_eq_mackeySubgroup_subgroupOf`: the stabilizer of `sH` in `K` is the Mackey
  subgroup.
* `TauCeti.mackeySubgroup_conj`: changing the double-coset representative conjugates the Mackey
  subgroup.
* `TauCeti.card_orbit_eq_relIndex`: the `K`-orbit of `sH` has as many elements as the Mackey
  subgroup has index in `K`.
* `TauCeti.relIndex_mackeySubgroup_conj`: that index depends only on the double coset.
* `TauCeti.card_doubleCoset_mul_card_mackeySubgroup`: the double-coset size formula
  `|KsH| · |K ⊓ sHs⁻¹| = |K| · |H|`.
