# Invariants of the dual representation

The dual `ρ.dual` of a representation acts on functionals by `ψ ↦ ψ ∘ ρ g⁻¹`, so a functional
invariant for it is exactly one that the action of `G` on the space leaves unchanged:
`ψ (ρ g u) = ψ u`.  That characterization of membership in `ρ.dual.invariants` is all a
construction out of an invariant functional, or of one, ever needs.

Counting those invariants needs the character machinery.  The character of the dual is the
character of `ρ` read along `g⁻¹`, and summing over the group is unchanged by inversion, so the two
averages agree: the dual has as many invariants as the representation itself.  Averaging characters
produces identities in `k` and nothing more, so that count is stated first in `k`, needing only an
invertible `|G|`; in characteristic `p` it is an identity of residues, and it is the injectivity of
`ℕ → k` in characteristic zero that turns it into an equality of dimensions.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Representation.mem_invariants_dual_iff`: a functional is invariant for `ρ.dual` exactly
  when the action of `G` leaves it unchanged, with
  `TauCeti.Representation.apply_of_mem_invariants_dual` the elimination direction.
* `TauCeti.Representation.finrank_invariants_dual`: **the dual of a representation has as many
  invariants as the representation**, as an identity in `k` whenever `|G|` is invertible
  (`TauCeti.Representation.finrank_invariants_dual_cast`) and as natural numbers in characteristic
  zero.

  `ρ.dual`, so counting them is counting invariants of a dual.

Averaging characters only ever produces identities in `k`.  In characteristic `p` this is one of
residues; see `TauCeti.Representation.finrank_invariants_dual` for the characteristic-zero form,
